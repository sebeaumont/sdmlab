SDMLAB - Sparse Distributed Memory Lab Project 
==============================================

This project is the Sparse Distributed Memory Research and Development
Hub.  The main artefact is the sdm runtime library and database
targetted to a number of platforms.

The application is high performance associative memory to further
research into the capabilities of a fully general model of sparse
encoding and hyper-dimensional sparse space.

We are also developing a DSL for ML based on SDM targetted at a number
of platforms using the following toolchain and libraries:

- clang, llvm
- ghc
- idris (dependant type language)
