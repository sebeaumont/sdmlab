# Hazel is My Person
This project is the Sparse Distributed Memory Engine Research and Development Hub.
The main artefact is the sdm runtime library and database.
The application is high performance associative memory to further research into the capabilities of a fully general model of sparse encoding and hyper-dimensional sparse space.

Key technologies used here:
- clang, llvm and friends
- ghc and friends

Packages we may leverage:
- accelerate, 
- hmatrix, 
- subhask, 
- hlearn

On the horizon make use of:
- EDSL for hardware description
- pure for signal processing
