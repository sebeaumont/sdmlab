* Optimization Notes
See makefile for specific commands but here are my understanding of
how this works:

For a 'gator vector in 32768 dimensions (1024 x i32) 4KB (a memory
page) if we use SIMD instructions that are 128b (16B = 4 x i32) wide
e.g. SSE4 then we need an unroll 1024/4 = 256 and a vector-width=16

for AVX 265b (32B = 8 x i32) we need to unroll factor 128 and vector
width 32

Assuming vector width is in bytes... hard to find this documentation
for LLVM optimizer and resort to reading source code!
