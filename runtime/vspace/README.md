# Runtime template library and test harness

## Core TODO

1. Bit vector initialisation including randomization of elemental
   white basis vectors (EWBV).

2. Semantic/Elemental/Composite vector algebra at space level should
   implement at binary_vector level.

3. Extending/shrinking mmf heap

4. C Wrapper and C++ library fascade
   build as shared library, (bitcode?) re-implement test
   harness/command line tool.

5. Benchmarks

## iOS Port 

1. Watch this space.
